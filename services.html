                <p>The BCAT is essentially an aptitude test for aspiring barristers, which must be sat in the summer
                    before you start the vocational component. The 55-minute test is computerised and is usually taken
                    in a local test centre. It is based on the Watson Glaser test methodology</p>
                <p>The test consists of 60 multiple choice questions, and is designed to test your critical thinking,
                    and understanding of arguments – identifying different perspectives and also your ability to
                    distinguish facts from opinions and assumptions. In order to pass the test and proceed with the
                    vocational component, you must answer at least half of the questions correctly. Once you have
                    completed the test, you will be given a print-out of your score immediately.</p>
                <p>If you fail the test, it is possible to re-sit it a further two times in any one calendar year
                    (subject to payment of the fees)</p>

                <p>Do you want to study at an institute for further or higher education? Do you want to study for professional qualifications in the UK? Then the General Certificate of Education (GCE) could help you.</p>
                <p>We at Techlogix Academy, understand the value of a solid educational foundation – a missing element among many students who come to our institute for professional colleges’ aptitude test preparation. Students nowadays do not have access to the guidance they need to capitalize on their potential and shape their own futures. For a bright future it is necessary that students have a solid base in their secondary education. At Techlogix Academy O/A level subject tuitions are being provided to do the needful. The education provided needs to be of a quality that will enable future generations to brace themselves for the challenges of an increasingly competitive world.

                </p>
                <p>Tests are conducted on a monthly basis and we provide ample time period for Past Paper practice. Mock Examinations are also held so the student may get accustomed to the pattern of CAIE examination.</p>
                <p>Our faculty comprises young and highly-motivated individuals who have strong educational backgrounds, an expertise in their subject areas and an understanding of the Cambridge Assessment International Examination (CAIE) systems. Our teaching methodologies stimulate thinking among students which is imperative to create an environment conducive to learning.</p>
